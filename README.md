# Active Learning for Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs)
This reporsitory contains the Gaussian Process Regressor codes used in this paper as well as the submission scripts/ workflow for the algoithm (design).

An example of Methane (using the log-spaced prior) in UiO-66 is shown in this repository.

All molecular simulations and GP data for all eleven MOFs are found in the GCMCxGP_Data folder.
